Code : Minimum Count
Send Feedback
Given an integer N, find and return the count of minimum numbers, sum of whose squares is equal to N.
That is, if N is 4, then we can represent it as : {1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} and {2^2}. Output will be 1, as 1 is the minimum count of numbers required.
Note : x^y represents x raise to the power y.
Input Format :
Integer N
Output Format :
Required minimum count
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 1000
Sample Input 1 :
12
Sample Output 1 :
3
Sample Output 1 Explanation :
12 can be represented as :
1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1
1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 2^2
1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 2^2 + 2^2
2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2
As we can see, the output should be 3.
Sample Input 2 :
9
Sample Output 2 :
1


Code : No. of balanced BTs
Send Feedback
Given an integer h, find the possible number of balanced binary trees of height h. You just need to return the count of possible binary trees which are balanced.
This number can be huge, so return output modulus 10^9 + 7.
Write a simple recursive solution.
Input Format :
Integer h
Output Format :
Count % 10^9 + 7
Input Constraints :
1 <= h <= 40
Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1:
15
Sample Input 2:
4
Sample Output 2:
315
